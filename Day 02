📅 Day 2 – SQL Problem Solving
🧠 Problem Focus:

Rising Temperature (Self Join & Date Comparison)

On Day 2, I practiced solving a time-series comparison problem using SQL.
The objective was to identify days where the temperature increased compared to the previous day.

🔎 Concepts Practiced:

Self Join

Date Functions (DATEDIFF, DATE_ADD)

Row-to-row comparison

Logical filtering using conditions

💻 Solution Approach:

Joined the Weather table with itself

Matched consecutive dates using date functions

Filtered records where today's temperature was higher than yesterday's


-- Day 2: Rising Temperature
-- Objective: Find days where temperature increased compared to the previous day

SELECT a.id
FROM Weather a
JOIN Weather b
ON DATEDIFF(a.recordDate, b.recordDate) = 1
AND a.temperature > b.temperature;
