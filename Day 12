Today I solved LeetCode 595 – Big Countries

📌 Problem Summary:

 We are given a World table containing country details.

 A country is considered “Big” if:

🌍 Area ≥ 3,000,000

 OR

👥 Population ≥ 25,000,000

🎯 Goal:

 Return the name, population, and area of big countries.

💡 SQL Solution:





SELECT name, population, area

FROM World

WHERE area >= 3000000

   OR population >= 25000000;



🧠 Key Learning:

Using WHERE with OR condition

Understanding how logical operators filter data

Clean and readable query matters
