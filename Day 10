🚀 Day 10 of #30DaysOfLeetCode

Today I solved Sales Person (Problem 607) on LeetCode.

📌 Problem Statement:

 Find the names of salespersons who did NOT have any orders with the company named "RED".



#  MySQL query statement below



select name 

from SalesPerson

where Sales_id  not in (

    select Sales_id 

    from orders 

    where Com_id=(

        select com_id 

        from Company

        where name = 'RED'

    ) 

);



SQL is not just about writing queries.

 It’s about understanding how databases actually evaluate logic.

Day by day, I’m strengthening my fundamentals.

Consistency > Motivation 💪
