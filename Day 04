💡 LeetCode 182 – Duplicate Emails

Today’s problem was about identifying duplicate records from a database.

📌 Problem Statement:
Given a Person table, find all email addresses that appear more than once.

🧠 Approach

This problem tests understanding of:

GROUP BY

HAVING

Aggregate functions like COUNT()

✅ SQL Solution
SELECT email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(email) > 1;

🔍 Why This Works?

GROUP BY email groups identical emails together

COUNT(email) counts occurrences

HAVING COUNT(email) > 1 filters only duplicates

Simple logic, but very important for real-world data cleaning and analysis 📊

🎯 Key Learning
