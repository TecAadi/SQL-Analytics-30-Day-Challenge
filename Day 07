💻 Problem 183 – Customers Who Never Order

Today I solved this problem using the NOT IN operator.

SELECT Name AS Customers
FROM Customers
WHERE Id NOT IN (
    SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders
);

🧠 My View:

This question is easy, but only if you clearly understand the use of the NOT operator.

The logic is simple:

Extract all CustomerId from Orders

Use NOT IN to filter customers whose Id is not present

Rename the column as Customers (important for LeetCode output)

At first, it looks very basic.
But this question strengthens the concept of filtering with subqueries.

One small thing I learned today 👇
⚠️ If the subquery contains NULL, NOT IN may not work as expected.
That’s why sometimes LEFT JOIN or NOT EXISTS is safer.

Small problem.
Clear logic.
Better SQL thinking every day 💪
