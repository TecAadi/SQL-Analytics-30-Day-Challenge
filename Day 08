Day 08/30 – LeetCode 184 | Department Highest Salary

Today’s SQL problem helped me strengthen my understanding of JOIN + GROUP BY + Derived Tables.

🔎 Problem:
Find employees who earn the highest salary in each department.

💡 Instead of using a correlated subquery, I used a more optimized approach:

1️⃣ First, calculate the maximum salary per department
2️⃣ Then, join it back with the Employee table
3️⃣ Finally, filter employees whose salary matches the department’s maximum

Here’s the solution I implemented:

SELECT d.name AS Department,
       e.name AS Employee,
       e.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d
  ON e.departmentId = d.id
JOIN (
    SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId
) m
ON e.departmentId = m.departmentId
AND e.salary = m.max_salary;


🧠 Key Learnings:

How GROUP BY helps aggregate data

How derived tables (subqueries in JOIN) work

Writing more efficient queries instead of correlated subqueries

Handling cases where multiple employees share the same highest salary
