🚀 Day 09 of 30 Days SQL Challenge

Today I solved LeetCode 196 – Delete Duplicate Emails.

The task was simple but tricky 👇
Delete duplicate email records from the Person table, while keeping the record with the smallest id.

🧠 Key Insight

Instead of using complex logic, we can use self join.

💡 Solution:
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1
JOIN Person p2
ON p1.email = p2.email
AND p1.id > p2.id;

🔎 What I Learned Today:

Self Join can be very powerful.

When two rows have same email, delete the one with larger id.

SQL problems are more about thinking clearly than writing long queries.

Sometimes the cleanest solution is the smartest one.

Every day I’m understanding SQL more deeply.
Small steps. Consistency. Growth. 📈
