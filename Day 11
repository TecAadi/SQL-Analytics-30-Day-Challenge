Day 11 of 30 Days of SQL 💻🔥

Today I solved the Employee Bonus problem.

📝 Problem Statement:

 We are given two tables: Employee and Bonus.

 The task is to find employees whose bonus is less than 1000.

 Also, employees who did not receive any bonus should be included.

💡 Key Learning:

 The important concept here is LEFT JOIN.



💻 SQL Solution:





SELECT e.name, b.bonus

FROM Employee e

LEFT JOIN Bonus b

ON e.empId = b.empId

WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL;



🎯 What I Learned Today:

Importance of LEFT JOIN

Handling NULL values correctly

Writing clean filtering conditions

Consistency > Motivation 🚀

 See you tomorrow for Day 12.
