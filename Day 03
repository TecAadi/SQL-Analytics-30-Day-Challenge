🏆 30 Days SQL Challenge
📌 Problem Statement

Find the Nth highest salary from the Employee table.

This is a classic SQL interview problem from LeetCode that tests understanding of:

Sorting (ORDER BY)

Handling duplicates (DISTINCT)

Offset logic (LIMIT)

Writing MySQL functions

💡 Approach

To make the solution structured and interview-ready, I implemented a MySQL function:

Declare a variable M

Set M = N - 1

Use LIMIT M, 1 to fetch the required salary

Use DISTINCT to handle duplicate salary values

Source code :

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE M INT;
SET M=N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT M, 1
  );
END
