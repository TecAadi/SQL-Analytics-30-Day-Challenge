🚀 Day 05/30 – SQL Challenge | Rank Scores

Today I solved Rank Scores from LeetCode (Problem 178).

📌 Problem Statement:
Rank the scores in descending order.
If two people have the same score → same rank.
No gaps in ranking.

🔎 Key Learning:
Used DENSE_RANK() window function.

SOURCE CODE:-

SELECT 
    Score,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS `Rank`
FROM Scores;


💡 Why DENSE_RANK()?

Same score → Same rank

No skipped ranks

Clean & efficient solution

Today’s takeaway:
Understanding ranking functions (RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()) is very important for real-world analytics problems.

Small steps daily → Big growth 📈
